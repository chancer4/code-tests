A palindrome is a word that's the same when it's read forward and backwards. "racecar" is a palindrome because it's the same when read backwards.

names.txt has 10,000 names and only one is a palindrome. Write a script/class to find the palindrome for the givent text file. 

p.s. for bonus points write a few specs.
